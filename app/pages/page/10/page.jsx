                    Veer was amazed. But he felt that Dadaji had started talking
                    about something else now. Getting impatient, he gently
                    returned to the topic he wanted to discuss.

                  <p className="py-4">
                    Veer - OK. But now we have been a free nation for more than
                    75 years. What are we doing now?
                  </p>
                  <p className="py-2">
                    Dadaji - Yes. You are right. In the last ten years, India
                    has made great progress in space exploration. We have become
                    atmanirbhar (self-reliant) in all fields from sea to space
                    and talent to technology. India now holds the world record
                    for sending 104 satellites in just one day!
                  </p>
                    {/* <p>
                    Veer - I know. I saw the satellites video on YouTube. It was
                    so interesting. Tell me Dadaji, what is so special about
                    Chandrayaan 3?
                  </p>
                  <p className="py-1">
                    Dadaji - You have asked a very good question. I will explain
                    in detail. Just then, Veerâ€™s mother entered the room with a
                    tray with two glasses of hot milk for both of them. Dadaji
                    took a sip.
                  </p>
                  <p className="py-1">
                    Veer adjusted his pillow to be even more comfortable. The
                    milk was too hot for him. He would wait a bit to drink it.
                  </p>
                  <p className="py-1">
                    Dadaji - The landing of Chandrayaan 3 is a matter of great
                    pride for us because India is the first country to
                    successfully land on the south pole of the moon. Our
                    scientists have achieved it at a very low cost of 620
                    million dollars which is almost half the cost of a
                    Hollywood movie.
