                    Veer - I know. I saw the satellites video on YouTube. It was
                    so interesting. Tell me Dadaji, what is so special about
                    Chandrayaan 3?
                  </p>
                  <p className="py-1">
                    Dadaji - You have asked a very good question. I will explain
                    in detail. Just then, Veerâ€™s mother entered the room with a
                    tray with two glasses of hot milk for both of them. Dadaji
                    took a sip.

                  <p className="py-1">
                    Veer adjusted his pillow to be even more comfortable. The
                    milk was too hot for him. He would wait a bit to drink it.

                  <p className="py-1">
                    Dadaji - The landing of Chandrayaan 3 is a matter of great
                    pride for us because India is the first country to
                    successfully land on the south pole of the moon. Our
                    scientists have achieved it at a very low cost of 620
                    million dollars which is almost half the cost of a
                    Hollywood movie.
